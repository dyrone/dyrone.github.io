my usual work content is more complicated, but I am participating and growing as
much as possible.

## Gerrit committer:

In the process of implementing the distributed architecture of Gerrit in
Alibaba, I made some commits to the core of Gerrit. Gerrit is implemented in
Java, so it is more comfortable for me. However, due to the work focus, I have
little time to contribute, but I still pay close attention to the development of
Gerrit frequently.
